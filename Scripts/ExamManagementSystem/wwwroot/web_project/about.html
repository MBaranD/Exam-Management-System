          We hear how much you miss your teachers from the first moment you go
          home after spending half your day at school, and after dinner, we know
          you say, "It would be very nice to solve a math exam now," don't
          worry, we're with you!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          IBS exam systems were established to implement the student, teacher,
          and exam relationship online.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the student panel, students will be able to take the exams added by
          their teachers and view the results of the exams they have taken.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the teacher panel, teachers will be able to add/remove exams to the
          system and see the students' results.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          On the admin panel, our authorized experts in the field and our
          officials, who are expected to get high marks from this project, are
          doing admin things :)
